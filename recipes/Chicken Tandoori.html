        <p>
            Tandoori chicken, a dish of roasted chicken marinated in yogurt and generously spiced, giving the meat <br>
            its trademark red colour. It is named for the cylindrical clay oven in which it is cooked, a tandoor. <br>
            The dish is attributed to Kundan Lal Gujral, a Hindu from Punjab state who fled newly formed Pakistan <br>
            after the 1947 partition of India and opened a restaurant in Delhi. Tandoori chicken quickly became<br>
            popular throughout South Asia and the Middle East as well as in Western countries. The spices most <br>
            commonly used include a mix called tandoori masala (typically cayenne pepper, garlic, ginger, onion,<br>
            and garam masala), red chili powder or Kashmiri chili powder, and sometimes turmeric and paprika. <br>
            Tandoori chicken is often served on the bones.<br>
