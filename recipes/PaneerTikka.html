            Paneer Tikka is a popular and delicious tandoori snack where<br>
            Paneer (Indian cottage cheese cubes) are marinated in a spiced<br>
            yogurt-based marinade, arranged on skewers and grilled in the oven.<br>
            Worry not if you don’t have an oven – instead of grilling in oven,<br>
            you can make Paneer Tikka Recipe on stovetop on a tawa/skillet.<br>
            In this post I am sharing both the oven and stovetop methods.<br>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                
                <li>
                    ¼ cup butter
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 pound paneer, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
                </li>
                <li>
                    2 medium onions, finely chopped
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 medium green bell pepper, chopped
                </li>
                <li>
                    2 medium jalapeno peppers, chopped
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 tablespoon ground cashews
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 teaspoon garlic paste
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 teaspoon garam masala
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 pint half-and-half
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>    
                <li>
                    <strong>Paneer (Indian Cottage Cheese):</strong> This is the main ingredient in <br>
                    the dish and it is important to use a good quality paneer. In fact,<br>
                    as with all my paneer recipes, I recommend using Homemade Paneer.<br>
                    This ensures freshness and avoids any hidden ingredients and <br>
                    preservatives found in store-bought paneer.
                </li>
                    <br>
                <li>
                    <strong> Homeade Hung Curd (Hung Yogurt): </strong>is used as the base of<br>
                    the marinade. You can even use Greek Yogurt. The ground spices are<br>
                    then added to balance out the sour yogurt taste and give a flavor <br>
                    kick to the dish.
                </li>
                    <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Veggies:</strong> Here I have used bell peppers (capsicum) and onions.<br>
                    You can use veggies of your choice, including baby corn, <br>
                    mushrooms, cauliflower, tomatoes, broccoli and more.<br>
                </li>
