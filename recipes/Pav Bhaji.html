            Pav Bhaji is a fast food dish from Mumbai (Bombay), India, consisting of a <br>
             vegetable curry (bhaji) cooked in tomato gravy and served with a soft bread <br>
             roll (pav). While Bhaji is a traditional Indian name for a vegetable dish, <br>
             the Pav or Pao was the Portuguese word for bread, which was introduced by <br>
             them during their brief presence in Mumbai around the mid-1500s.
